      <p>As the Rogue of the Alliance in World of Warcraft with experience on private servers (Eternal WoW, Pandashan, WoW Arena, Warmane, Unlimited WoW), I'll teach you rogue's mechanics, techniques, skills and crafts against all your enemies.</p>
	  
	  <p>I will also teach you how to gear up, what gems to set, which potions to use, which enchants to integrate, how to clear up dungeons as rogue solo style, how to counter your enemies, and so on.</p>

      <p>I will help you optimize your existing gear (if you're an existing player of rogue) and become a fearless rogue in world of warcraft while jumping in the battleground.</p>
	  
	  <p>Please note: I am NOT good at PVP 1-1 or 2v2 therefore I do not provide class training for such thing. I am only a BG player so my coaching and training revolved around battlegrounds and dungeons.</p>

      <p>Check my gameplay screenshots to see my rogue's stats.</p>
	  
      <p>If there will be any questions, you can surely ask during our sessions.</p>

		<button class="accordion-button" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#answer1">
		  Do I need to already know how to play World of Warcraft before booking?
		</button>
	  </h2>
	  <div id="answer1" class="accordion-collapse collapse" data-bs-parent="#faqAccordion">
		<div class="accordion-body">
		  No. Whether you are a complete beginner or an experienced player, I will adapt the coaching to your skill level. You’ll learn step by step and at your own pace.
		</div>
	  </div>
	</div>

	<div class="accordion-item">
	  <h2 class="accordion-header" id="faq2">
		<button class="accordion-button collapsed" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#answer2">
		  Which version of World of Warcraft do you coach?
		</button>
	  </h2>
	  <div id="answer2" class="accordion-collapse collapse" data-bs-parent="#faqAccordion">
		<div class="accordion-body">
		  I specialize in WoW Classic 3.3.5 (WotLK) on private servers. My experience comes from servers like Eternal WoW, Pandashan, WoW Arena, Warmane, and Unlimited WoW. I have played Cataclysm and Mist of Pandaria as well but I am NOT coaching for that. However, if you insist, you can request for custom coaching regarding Rogue's training on those private servers. Be sure that I do not have those versions installed on my computer so a remote Zoom meeting would be required with remote access so I can teach and guide using your computer remotely.
		</div>
	  </div>

	<div class="accordion-item">
	  <h2 class="accordion-header" id="faq3">
		<button class="accordion-button collapsed" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#answer3">
		  Do you only coach Rogue class?
		</button>
	  </h2>
	  <div id="answer3" class="accordion-collapse collapse" data-bs-parent="#faqAccordion">
		<div class="accordion-body">Yes, I am coaching for Rogue only. It doesn't mean I don't know other classes. I have played them so I know about their spells, mechanics, weaknesses etc. However, this service is dedicated to Rogue for PVE and PVP in battlegrounds.</div>

		<button class="accordion-button collapsed" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#answer4">
		  How is the training conducted?
		</button>
	  </h2>
	  <div id="answer4" class="accordion-collapse collapse" data-bs-parent="#faqAccordion">
		<div class="accordion-body">
		  All training will be held on Zoom, where I will share my screen, demonstrate mechanics, and explain strategies in real time. For the "Play Game with Me" and "Mastering World of Warcraft" packages, we will play together in-game on the same server of your choice. Remember, I might not have full class ready on your choice of server so for the training purpose, you will have to go on a server where full gear is provided free of cost with instant level 80 in WoW Classic 3.3.5.

	  <h2 class="accordion-header" id="faq5">
		<button class="accordion-button collapsed" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#answer5">
		  What if I only want help with one specific area (like leveling or battlegrounds)?
		</button>
	  </h2>
	  <div id="answer5" class="accordion-collapse collapse" data-bs-parent="#faqAccordion">
		<div class="accordion-body">
		  That’s fine. The $50 "Ask Your Question" package is perfect for focused, short-term guidance on any specific concern. You can also pick a weekly session if you want regular, short-term support.

		</button>
	  </h2>
	  <div id="answer6" class="accordion-collapse collapse" data-bs-parent="#faqAccordion">
		<div class="accordion-body">
		  Yes. For the monthly package, we will play and train as much as you want throughout the month, based on your schedule and desire.

		</button>
	  </h2>
	  <div id="answer7" class="accordion-collapse collapse" data-bs-parent="#faqAccordion">
		<div class="accordion-body">
		  I don’t guarantee anything except that you'll not remain the same as of now. I will make you a brave and confident rogue. That's a promise but you have to put your efforts and practice it yourself. I can teach, guide, demonstrate but in the end it is all about your own performance based on your mindset and how you act or react to various situations.

		</button>
	  </h2>
	  <div id="answer8" class="accordion-collapse collapse" data-bs-parent="#faqAccordion">
		<div class="accordion-body">
		  No problem. Training is personalized to your availability and goals. Even short, focused practical training can produce clear progress and I'll give you homework to improve your performance.

	  </h2>
	  <div id="answer9" class="accordion-collapse collapse" data-bs-parent="#faqAccordion">
		<div class="accordion-body">
		 I am not selling their accounts so that is not their concern. You are just a player on their server, connected to me remotely in-game while talking online.
