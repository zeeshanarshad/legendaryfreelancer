            <p class="lead">I started my programming career back in 1999 after extensive experiences with computer hardware and software then I performed job in a software company and internet services provider for 2 years where I self-studied various technologies from the internet resources despite this fact that my seniors always pushed me back and never supported me to step ahead and get any higher position but I suffered it all just because I wanted to support my family and siblings and every one does in his life when there is no supporter except the Lord &amp; God, ALLAH the Greatest Mighty King of Universe.</p>
            <p class="lead">After quitting  my job of pain and stress by working every single day and sleep for almost 2 hour a day, I completed my college education and dropped my university to continue supporting my family and became a private and independent freelancer by working together with private clients on international level and stopped working with local Pakistani due to so much deception, frauds, cruelty  in society against women, tortures, emotional abuses, lies and so much against the teachings of Islam.</p>
            <p class="lead">I always hated those liars and deceptive company owners and when I tried to do some jobs in local offices while I was working as a full time freelancer, I couldn't stay longer with them due to their policies of working on any kind of websites such as porn, nude women etc just for the sake of dollars and looting international clients with cheap tactics in their offices which were against my own freelance policies and beliefs so I dropped them and continued my freelancing journey.</p>
            <p class="lead">In 2012, my freelancing account with vWorker got devastated  and vanished due to migration of platform and merging with freelancer. Fortunately, I didn't lose my reviews and reputation but the platform had gone, which was my chosen one and where I had established myself as top 1% freelancer within a span of 7 years with a full 5-star profile.</p>
            <p class="lead">After migration, I started the journey with Freelancer but that platform never suited me due to so much spam, scam and deception game by their authorities, I lettered them many times and taught them what to do and implement but they never listened instead they further damaged their platform by adding more looting stuff to fool freelancers and never worked against those spammers and scam clients who wanted to misuse freelancers and beginners who were getting damage for the money.</p>
            <p class="lead">I investigated other ways to make money online and discovered online course creation, this leaded me to reach Udemy and become a Teacher Online then I transferred  my coding skills by transforming my knowledge into online crash courses and eliminated learning gap from my students to never go into useless theories of programming  which were not essentials for practical and professional web development at all.</p>
            <p class="lead">My courses became successful and students loved my approach but this wasn't going well in terms of business so I also started looking other ways and stepped into becoming an influencer in Freelancing industry and utilized my gaming experience to as a VR Influencer too, both in Urdu language and in Pakistan.</p>
            <p class="lead"><img src="images/story/profile-vr-zeeshan-arshad.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Zeeshan Arshad (Legendary Freelancer)"></p>
            <p class="lead">However...</p>
		  <p class="lead">That was the decision which led me into encountering emotional mental death.</p>
		  <p class="lead">How?</p>
		  <p class="lead">Here is the story of how it went through...</p>
		  <p class="lead">I started going into Facebook groups with the intention to help freelancing beginners of Pakistan (even some entrepreneurs by visiting their physical offices), I encountered so much jealousy, emotional abuse, mental torture, and envy against me from Pakistani freelancers and entrepreneurs even though I was just selflessly helping them.</p>
		  <p class="lead">I wanted to teach and educate them in native Urdu language but they considered me an illiterate who does not know anything about Freelancing and English communication so as a result they blocked, mocked, abused, insulted and pushed me back.</p>
		  <p class="lead">I was keep absorbing their bad and insulting behaviors and also ignoring them until one day I encountered very severe insult in a software house where I visited to help that entrepreneur for his business, when I shared that story to my wife, she told me that I've had been brutally insulted and did nothing to answer back?</p>
		  <p class="lead">It was the moment in a sudden I realized what happened to me and how I was being fooled by  society and mistreated with no respect!</p>
		  <p class="lead">This self-realization and REFLECTION was so unbearable that I couldn't bear the damage and started bleeding emotionally, mentally and it also affected my freelance business and I got bankrupt because I wasn't able to turn on computer and write programming anymore like before, the screen was giving me severe anxiety, pain, stress and I was having so much noise in my head like spinning processor of computer with loudness. Slowly, it poisoned  me and my brain malfunctioned. I was not even able to express my thoughts in words to ask for help in Facebook groups and no one knew what's going on with me except ALLAH (اللہ) </p>
		  <p class="lead">I was so mad, angry, full of hatred, frustration and a wounded lion who wanted to COMEBACK! for REVENGE from cruel people of the society but my mindset was not working properly and I was unable to understand what's going on with me???</p>
		  <p class="lead">I did not tell anyone in my family and relatives what actually happened to me but what will happen next and how to come out from this unresolved mystery of my life ever? That was the real question for me! </p>
		  <p class="lead">I started finding solutions on the internet but everywhere I was encountering email captures, false techniques by marketing gurus, purchase X course, buy Y program etc...and I was feeling frustrated with no proper solution then...</p>
		  <p class="lead">I Promised ALLAH (اللہ) </p>
		  <p class="lead" align="center"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Bz0s9-fHUNE/"><img src="images/story/legend-claims-2019.jpg" class="img-fluid img-thumbnail" alt="Zeeshan Arshad (Legendary Freelancer)"></a></p>
		  <p class="lead">I had emotionally, mentally and almost physically died in 2018-2019 because I spiritually experienced my personality got shattered into more than 40 pieces and each piece of my body was glowing like a diamond gem with so much emitting  energies from it, each piece was looking like waiting to be combined to become a very powerful diamond with supreme energy but how??? I had no idea and no answer. </p>
		  <p class="lead">I searched about such split personality experiences and discovered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split_(2016_American_film)">Split</a> movie but it didn't help me. However, I realized multiple personalities is something for real but I did not believe in one thing that &quot;it was a disease&quot; or &quot;multiple personality disorder&quot; as preached by psychologists and medical specialists so I REJECTED all their words, theories and started the mission to find the truth myself behind it like computer programming where I used to find solutions to problems. </p>
		  <p class="lead">I was very fond of mystical stories, spiritual powers, video games, horror movies, superhero cartoons and martial arts since childhood so I did not give up and challenged myself to continue this battle and I worked hard every single day, every single hour, every single minute to learn more, start spiritual experiments, transform myself and come out from the darkness of my life ever encountered!</p>
