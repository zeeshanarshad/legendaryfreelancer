            <p class="lead">20 years ago, I started my career without computer science degree with basic coding skills. I had fear of speaking on audio/video call with international clients but I sold high ticket web services using chat and became vWorker's top 1% coder and ranked #177 out of 290,940+ (higher than 99.94% peers) and Freelancer's top contributing freelancer.</p> 
            <p class="lead">You DO NOT need to be an expert to be successful because you only need to solve problems for people, deliver results as you promise, stay active for clients without compromising on quality, go above and beyond their expectations in order to receive a perfect 5-star review, this is how I achieved every single 5-star review WITHOUT any negative review in my career life span of 14+ years as a freelancer.</p>
            <p class="lead">I can read/write and understand English and I'm still not perfect but I've helped hundreds of international clients all over the world in various languages.</p>
          <p class="lead">So don't feel like a loser if you are not perfect and you are suffering, frustrated and confused about online earning (specially freelancing), learning too much, have fears and feeling insecure by success stories of millionaires?</p>
            <p class="lead">You have your own journey to go so I will give you <a href="resources.htm">free resources</a> without capturing your email to spam you later, without asking your contact # to pitch you any offer, without making you my blind follower to stay behind me. </p>

		<h2>But...now my comeback story!</h2>
		
		<p>I have had been in the IT Industry for 14+ years and maintained a perfect 5-star profile by the mercy of ALLAH (اللہ)</p>
		<p align="center"><img src="images/story/profile-freelancer-zeeshan-arshad.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Zeeshan Arshad (Legendary Freelancer)"></p>

		<p>2015 was the year when I started my online teaching and training business through online courses at Udemy for additioal passive income where I have over 2300+ reviews and 45k+ students so far by the mercy of ALLAH (اللہ)</p>
		<p align="center"><img src="images/story/profile-teacher-zeeshan-arshad.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Zeeshan Arshad (Legendary Freelancer)"></p>

		<p>In addition, I also planned to become a Gaming Influencer in Virtual Reality in Urdu language so I purchased Samsung Gear VR and HTC Vive to start testing virtual reality games and helped game developers and companies improve their games, increase their sales and transform their negative reviews into positive one with my ideas, suggestions and advices.</p>
		<p align="center"><img src="images/story/profile-vr-zeeshan-arshad.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Zeeshan Arshad (Legendary Freelancer)"></p>

		  <p>However... when I started going into Facebook groups with intention to help freelancing beginners of Pakistan (even some entrepreneurs by visiting their physical offices), I encountered so much jealousy and envy against me from Pakistani freelancers and entrepreneurs even though I was helping them for free and selflessly but it did not work well at least for me in local community.</p>
		  <p>I was intend to teach and educate them in Urdu language while they considered me an illiterate person who does not know anything about Freelancing and English communication so as a result they started blocking, mocking, abusing, insulting and pushing me back. I was keep neglecting their bad and insulting behaviors until one day I encountered severe insult in a software house and told that story to my wife. She told me that I've had been insulted and did nothing to answer? It was the moment in a sudden I realized what happened to me and how I was being fooled by the society and mistreated with no respect.</p>
		  <p>This self-realization and REFLECTION was so unbearable that I couldn't bear the damage and started bleeding emotionally, mentally and in fact my career got affected and I got bankrupt because I couldn't continue programming, writing and reading anymore properly and my brain started to malfunction in extreme noise, pain and stress. I was not even able to express my thoughts in words to ask for help in Facebook groups and no one knew what's going on with me on internal level except ALLAH (اللہ)</p>
		  <p>I became so mad, anger, full of hatred, frustrated and wounded lion who wanted to comeback to take REVENGE from cruel people of the society but my mindset was not working properly and I was unable to understand what's going on with me??? I did not tell anyone in my family and relatives what actually happened to me but what will happen next and how to come out from this unresolved mystery of my life ever? That was the real question for me!</p>
		  <p>I started finding solutions on the internet but everywhere I was encountering email captures, false techniques by marketing gurus, purchase X course, buy Y program etc...and I was feeling frustrated with no proper solution then ...I promised ALLAH (اللہ)<br>
		  </p>

	    <p>I had emotionally, mentally and almost physically died in 2018-2019 because I spiritually experienced my personality got shattered into more than 40 pieces and each piece of my body was glowing like a diamond gem with so much emiting energies from it, each piece was looking like waiting to be combined to become a very powerful diamond with supreme energy but how??? I had no idea.</p>
	    <p>I searched about such experience and found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split_(2016_American_film)">Split Movie</a> but it didn't help me. However, I realized multiple personalities is something for real but I did not believe that it was a disease or something what medical doctors are saying or psychologists are preaching so I REECTED their words and theories and started the mission to find the truth myself.</p>
	    <p>Since, I was very fond of mystical stories, spiritual powers, video games, horror movies, superhero cartoons and martial arts since childhood so I did not give up and challenged myself to continue this battle. I worked hard every single day, every single hour, every single minute to learn more, do practical experiments and come out from this darkness of my life ever encountered!</p>

		 <p>My Comeback Like a Storm is connected with Storm of Coronavirus in all over the world because those were the moments when I was about to comeback in public with my new and powerful personality like never before and that was a mid-night when I got INSTANT TRANSFORMATION by the Command of ALLAH (اللہ) the Holy Mighty King of Universe to RETURN as LEGEND!</p>
		 <p align="center"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNhx2yyZDZc"><img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/GNhx2yyZDZc/hqdefault.jpg" class="card-img-top img-thumbnail" alt="Legendary Freelancer Story"></a></p>

		<p>But...I am NOT a magician. I have had been supported by the Glorious People of Islam through dreams and in real life. Through prayers of a Muslim Saint of Islam, my physical body was transformed with endowed Holy Powers to never be infected by any wave of corona virus and I became Divine Immune forever without any vaccine and medicine usage. Now, I can never die with any wave of corona virus ever and it is by the Mercy of ALLAH (اللہ)</p>

		 <p>Indeed, ALLAH (اللہ) is the Creator, Originator and Controller of Coronavirus. To Him belongs the Kingdom of the Heavens and the Earth. He gives whom He wills without measures and He bestows upon His mercy on whomsoever He wills. None can stop ALLAH (اللہ)</p>

		 <p>I have now RETURNED with ALLAH (اللہ) the Holy Mighty King of Universe who performed countless <a href="miracles.htm">miracles</a> in physical world to help me reawaken my faith and conviction on truth of religion Islam while utilizing modern technologies.</p>
