		<p><strong>Prophet Muhammadﷺ was a Multi-Talented Human Prophet of God</strong> on planet earth. He should be the role model for all mankind on planet earth. He performed multiple roles <strong>PERFECTLY</strong> with <strong>EXCELLENCE</strong>. It clearly means that living a life without hiding yourself should be embraced by you if you are multi talented and you should not worry about what the people of society are thinking about you or saying against you on because most people live their life in fears by hiding their true personality from other people and they do not practically follow Islam but their own worldly desires with no true knowledge of Quran and Sunnah.</p>
		<p>They live with shame, sadness, traumas, insecurities, fears and so many other stuff for which they never truly seriously work to heal and recover from. I personally observed thousands of people on planet earth in my life and concluded that most people are living their life like an animal where they don't really use their brain regarding what they are actually doing in their life, why they are living and what is the purpose of their life? </p>
		<p>So if you belong to the category of multi talented people, don't be ashamed of yourself.</p>
		<p>You will find hatred against you by the odds because they will feel jealous of you when they see your personality with so many skills, characters, roles, abilities and other stuff but you don't have to care about them because they are not paying your bills.</p>
	  <p>You are given just one life by the God so live it to the excellence and do your best whatever you can do with your skills, abilities and resources for the happiness of God for which you will need to do good deeds and you will encounter evil people during your journey who will try to pull you down and live the limited life like them and become normal like them and do not think extraordinary which they believe as impossible.</p>
		<p>I have achieved extraordinary success in my life by the mercy of Allah and what I have achieved looks impossible to 99% people of planet earth because they never attempted to do it so they never achieved that due to their own limitations. On a personal side, I help non muslims, ex muslims, atheists and doubtful muslims know the truth of religion Islam through miracles and divine signs which have been given to me from the Holy Lord of Universe.  </p>
