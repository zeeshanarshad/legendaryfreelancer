	<div class="col-md-8 offset-md-2 col-12"> <p>Welcome! I am Zeeshan Arshad the Legendary Freelancer of Pakistan. I am the King of Multiple Skills &amp; Master Trainer of Multiple Skills by the Mercy of Allahﷻ the Glorious Holy Mighty King of Universe. I work for Islam on social media and with a background in gaming, spirituality, programming, coding, writing, martial arts and much more, I am here today as Legendary Freelancer, offering legendary services for elite customers who want to work with a highly ranked freelancer of both, technical and spiritual domains.</p>
	  <p dir="ltr">I have achieved great results and ranks in gaming, spirituality, programming and freelancer. Not to forget about religion where I am an undefeatable debater of Islam on social media. With dozens of miracles under my belt by the Permission of Allahﷻ, I am the Glorious Master of Spirituality who can never be defeated by any non-Muslim when it comes to defending the Islam on social media or elsewhere in the world.</p>
	  <p dir="ltr">This website is the testament of my glorious work by the Mercy of Allahﷻ as well as some of my legendary services that I am offering with help of whatever resources I have in my contact, physically or spiritually. My results are clear performances of my work and the results are miracles by Allahﷻ who is the ultimate healer and performer of those miracles, not me. I am just grateful to Allah for giving me a chance for the Glory of Islam and to come up on the stage as the &quot;Legend&quot;.</p>
	  <p dir="ltr">Feel free to check my services, work results, client testimonials and contact me should you need any help regarding any of your concerns but remember that my charges are very high and so are my services and results. Not everyone can work together with me due to my rates and it is perfectly acceptable to me because I want to care about my results and happiness of clients, not greedy to work with everyone at cheap cost.</p>
	  <p dir="ltr">If you wish to hire me for technical work, please first consult with me since I am mostly involved in non-tech work now due to Islamic mission and research routines. My technical portfolio will be provided upon request as it is not much necessary now with my legendary status (Alhamdulillah)</p>
