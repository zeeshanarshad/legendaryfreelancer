<p>I'm Zeeshan Arshad. A Legendary Freelancer, Gamer and Spiritual Scientist. I have been doing my freelancing business for the last 20 years through the internet. First I started working as a IT Professional then upgraded my various skills and came into Spiritual Technologies.</p>

<p>I have unique experiences from multiple fields and a proud Jack-of-All-Trades against the odds who pro-claim that Multi-Talented individuals cannot do anything in their lives. So if you are amongst those multi-talented who always feel inferior to society full of experts with specialists, stop lowering and degrading yourself anymore!</p>

<p>I am right here in front of you, a living example of success in multiple fields by the Mercy of Allah.

<p>Beyond my technical expertise, I have done countless spiritual experiments and achieved extraordinary spiritual results and performed miracles including reviving the dead, healing incurable natural creatures with touch of my hands or by reciting the Legendary Holy Quran as well as transform the weather systems through prayers or just by saying some words by the Permission of Allah</p>


<p>People from all over the world come to me for help through inbox on various of my social media accounts. I have been able to help individuals and couples heal and transform their lives with my counseling, coaching and guidance. I name it Legendary Chat and provide help overcoming depression, stress, and emotional trauma. Most of my results happen within hours and in some cases within minutes as well by the Grace of Allah.</p>

<p>With over 500 articles, 2 self-published ebooks, 5,000+ answers provided on Quora, and 3,000+ YouTube videos covering a wide range of topics from freelancing, technology, gaming to spirituality, my content offers inspiration, education, transformation, knowledge and wisdom to global audience in English and Urdu languages.
 
<p>This website is combination of my results, services and resources to help individuals and freelancers whether you are professional or non-professional, it does not matter to me.
