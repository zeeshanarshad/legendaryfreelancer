   <p data-start="598" data-end="1048"><strong>A Gamer turned Legendary Freelancer, Powered by ALLAH </strong><strong>the God of Universe</strong> in the 21st century of modern science &amp; technologies on a mission for proving the truth of Islam to all the disbelievers of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@godofnature/playlists" target="_blank">AllahÔ∑ª</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@prophetofnature" target="_blank">Prophet MuhammadÔ∑∫</a></p>
   <p data-start="598" data-end="1048">Through my  work, I have practically demonstrated <a href="miracles.htm">miracles</a> that reflect the profound wisdom and truth revealed in the Holy Quran to <strong>Prophet MuhammadÔ∑∫ the Ultimate Final Holy Messenger of ALLAH (ÿßŸÑŸÑ€Å)</strong> </p>
   <p data-start="1050" data-end="1347">My professional journey began as a computer hardware and software professional, followed by passion for creating computer softwares ended up being a web developer, working with international clients since 2002, helping them develop their websites, custom web-based softwares and business management systems. However, despite my success and top 1% ranking in web development as a freelance web developer, I felt lost in life and encountered a personal crisis‚Äî<a href="story.htm">my story</a> I can only describe as emotional and mental death.</p>
   <p data-start="1349" data-end="1718">Through deep reflection, I embarked on a journey of self-discovery. I realized that true success lies in personal transformation and spiritual awakening. I began integrating not only technical skills but spiritual wisdom, seeking the deeper meaning of life. This led me to understand that Allah is the Almighty Creator, and He has FULL POWER to do anything He wants whether it is healing the incurable, transforming the weather or reviving the dead back to life.</p>
   <p data-start="1720" data-end="2149">With a passion for gaming, mystical stories, and the inspiring lives of Muslim Saints, I began to realize my own potential‚Äînot just as a freelancer, but as a curious soul with a thirst for knowledge. I understood that I am a "multipotentialite"‚Äîa person with the capacity to excel in many areas. From learning technical skills to uncovering profound spiritual insights, I realized my true self as a "gamer" with a higher purpose.</p>
   <p data-start="2151" data-end="2424">Now, I help gamers become powerful versions of themselves in real life by upgrading their characters with technical and spiritual skills. </p>
   <p data-start="2426" data-end="2594">Together, Insha'Allah, the gamers will bring true revolution in this world by the Mercy of AllahÔ∑ª the Mighty Holy King of Universe. </p>

By integrating modern skills with profound spiritual wisdom, I aim to not only teach technical expertise but also help people discover their true potential, ultimately contributing to the betterment of society and the world.

Through personalized guidance, I share strategies for finding projects, setting competitive rates, overcoming self-doubts, and showing yourself online with full confidence by understanding yourself and your services with the outcome that only you can provide the best amongst your competitors. This also included mindset coaching, helping you develop resilience and confidence in your freelancing journey. Additionally, I offer support with counseling, consulting and effective organization of your talents, skills, expertise and decades of experience into streamline single business effectively instead of feeling confused and overwhelmed.</p>
	<hr>
	<p><strong>6. What sets you apart from other freelancers and mentors in the industry?</strong><br>

My approach is holistic, helping you not only succeed in freelancing but also grow personally and professionally. I&rsquo;ve proven that freelancers can achieve success by continuously learning, adapting, and helping others in their journey.

	<hr>
	<p><strong>7. Do you offer free services or resources for people who cannot afford to pay?</strong><br>
    Yes, I strongly believe in helping those who are in need, particularly the underprivileged. I provide free services to those who cannot afford to pay, including free educational resources, mentorship, and occasional healing services. My goal is to empower people, especially the less fortunate, with knowledge and skills that can change their lives. However, since I believe in teaching others, most of the information I provide is already on the internet for free in the form of my videos, articles, online courses or resources in multiple ways for those who want to take benefit through my wisdom and knowledge without requiring anything to pay me. Even for healing, one can learn spiritual skills and become self-sufficient spiritual freelancer on his/her way and make money healing incurable patients by the Power of AllahÔ∑ª</p>
	<hr>
	<p><strong>8. How do you combine spirituality with your freelancing career?</strong><br>
	  I integrate spirituality into my work by invoking ALLAHÔ∑ª through prayers and using Holy Quran with the wisdom of Islamic teachings to guide my actions and approach to freelancing. This includes offering spiritual guidance, healing, and incorporating values like honesty, respect, and humility into every interaction. I also use my platform to teach others about the importance of faith and self-awareness in achieving both personal and professional success.</p>
	<hr>
	<p><strong>9. What are your core values as a Legendary Freelancer?</strong><br>

	  <li><strong>Adaptability</strong>: Evolving with the changing needs of clients and industries.</li>
	  <li><strong>Faith</strong>: Incorporating Islamic teachings in all aspects of my work.</li>
	  <li><strong>Empathy</strong>: Understanding the needs of others and providing solutions with care.</li>
   </ul>
	<hr>
	<p><strong>10. Can you help me become a confident freelancer online?</strong><br>
    Yes, I specialize in web development and personal development. I can help you become a very well confident freelancer online through my personal development expertise and help you shine out in the online space with full confidence without falling back again & again due to lack of confidence, self-doubts, fears, insecurities, confusions, stress, social anxiety etc.</p>
	<hr>
	<p><strong>11. How do I get started with your professional services?</strong><br>
    It's very simple, just <a href="contact.htm">contact me</a>  with your requirements and budget then I'll further discuss with you as required.</p>
	<hr>
	<p><strong>12. What is your approach to client relationships and communication?</strong><br>
    I believe in building strong, long-term relationships with clients based on mutual trust, clear communication, and respect. I always listen to my clients&rsquo; needs, ensure that I understand their problems and challenges, and work together to deliver the result they desire. I provide regular updates, ask for feedback, and ensure that result is provided within agreed deadline once the project is started after payment is funded by client into my bank account online or through safe methods shared privately with escrow and protection for both sides such as using Upwork's payment escrow system or some other freelancing platform if client has hesitation of sending payment directly due to the nature of meeting me first time and I truly understand this aspect so that's not a big deal with me as long as my client is well satisfied and peaceful without being worried.</p>
	<hr>
	<p><strong>13. Do you work with clients from all over the world?</strong><br>
    Of course! I work with clients globally. My international freelancing business is not restricted by any location. I have full extensive experience working with international clients globally during various time zones. No matter where ever you are located in the world, when you are with me, you feel like having me together with you without any long distance because I always make myself available to serve my clients as fast as possible even if I do have to sacrifice my sleep in urgent case scenarios when working on urgent projects with tight deadlines or serious issues such as troubleshooting an extensive problem causing headache to my clients.</p>
	<hr>
	<p><strong>14. Can you help me grow my business as a freelancer?</strong><br></p>
	<p dir="ltr">No, I do not help freelancers grow their businesses because that's the responsibility of a freelancer to grow his/her business with what works best in his/her case. However, I provide the best ideas and strategies, suggestions and new perspectives through which a freelancer learns and understands how he/she can scale their income or double, triple their revenue without changing much their strategy if they are already making money through their existing skill. One must know how to make money in order to receive such guidance through me. This is not for absolute beginners who are just starting out and never made any money online as a freelancer.</p>
	<p dir="ltr">I can help you define your niche, increase your rates, understand high-paying clients for your niche, and set up systems that allow you to operate efficiently. Whether you're just starting out or looking to expand, I&rsquo;ll provide guidance on starting or growing a freelance business online (and offline too if you wish so from Pakistan).</p>
   <hr>
	<p><strong>15. What types of projects do you specialize in?</strong><br>
	  I specialize in a wide range of projects, including:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li><strong>Web Development</strong> (custom websites, e-commerce, web apps)</li>
	  <li><strong>Game Development</strong> (game testing, ideas for improvement)</li>
	  <li><strong>Personal Development</strong> (healing, coaching, counseling, mentoring)</li>
	  <li><strong>Video Editing</strong> (youtube content, udemy courses short films)</li>
	  <li><strong>Consulting</strong> (freelancing, religion, passive income, gods)</li>
   </ul>
	<hr>
   <p><strong>16. What are some of your past successful projects or client stories?</strong><br>
   I  worked with wide varieties of clients from various industries, from website development to game testing. One of my most notable successes was helping a client transform and upgrade a virtual reality cricket game on steam platform that increased their sales and turned negative reviews into positive reviews after applying my ideas and suggestions. Feel free to check my <a href="portfolio.htm">portfolio</a> page.</p>
	<hr>
	<p><strong>17. How can I integrate my passion (e.g., gaming, tech, religion, sports, etc) with freelancing?</strong><br>
    Integrating your passion with freelancing involves aligning your skills and expertise with something you truly enjoy and connecting it to the value you can offer. For example, if you&rsquo;re passionate about gaming, you could create gaming-related content, offer game testing services, or even work on game development. For those passionate about tech, freelancing opportunities include web development, IT support, or technology consulting. If sports excite you, you could offer content creation for sports blogs, sports analytics, or coaching services. Similarly, if your passion lies in religion, you can integrate spiritual guidance, religious content creation, or consulting in faith-based projects. By aligning your freelancing work with your passion, you&rsquo;ll naturally stay motivated and attract clients who share similar interests, creating a fulfilling and sustainable career.</p>
	<hr>
	<p><strong>18. Can you personally guide me if I'm just starting out in freelancing?</strong><br>
	  Absolutely! Whether you&rsquo;re just starting out or have some experience, I can help guide you through the early stages of freelancing. Through online mentoring, I&rsquo;ll show you how to find clients, set your rates, and start your freelancing career with ease. Everyone starts somewhere, and I&rsquo;m here to help you kick start your freelancing career online. The rest you can do it yourself based on provided guidelines, ideas and strategies. The best way to learn is by doing it yourself, anyway :)</p>
	<hr>
	<p><strong>19. How can I learn through your videos for free?</strong></p>
	<p>Learn through my videos which are available for free to the people of this world. They are already created for answering real world questions by random people who were suffering in various kind of issues in their lives and much of everything has been concluded for those who want to save and change themselves forever.</p>
