   <h3><strong>Introduction:</strong></h3>
	<p dir="ltr">I am a freelancer and work for my clients. I am also active on social media for the Glory of Islam and also teach my students online. I have multiple characters and I am not shy about saying that I am The King of Multiple Skills by the Grace of Allah. If anyone needs any help from me, they can contact me on Skype. This page is about me, about my achievements and about my qualities and other related resources so that everyone should know that when Allah helps someone, He makes him unmatched.</p>
	<p class="urdu">میں ایک فری لانسر ہوں اور اپنے کلائنٹس کے لیے کام کرتا ہوں۔ میں سوشل میڈیا پر دین اسلام کے لیے بھی ایکٹو ہوں اور اپنے اسٹوڈنٹس کو آن لائن تعلیم بھی دیتا ہوں۔میرے مختلف کردار ہیں اور میں کسی سے شرماتا نہیں اپنے اس معاملے میں کہ میں ملٹی پل کرداروں کا مالک ہوں بفضل اللہ۔اگر کسی کو مجھ سے کوئی مدد چاہیے تو وہ مجھ سے اسکائپ پر رابطہ کرے۔ یہ پیج میرے بارے میں، میرے کارناموں کے بارے میں اور میری خصوصیات کے بارے میں اور دیگر وسائل سے متعلقہ ہے تاکہ سب لوگ یہ جان لیں کہ جب اللہ کسی کی مدد کرتا ہے تو وہ اسے بے مثال بنادیتا ہے۔<br>

Through personalized guidance, I share strategies for finding projects, setting competitive rates, overcoming self-doubts, and showing yourself online with full confidence by understanding yourself and your services with the outcome that only you can provide the best amongst your competitors. This also included mindset coaching, helping you develop resilience and confidence in your freelancing journey. Additionally, I offer support with counseling, consulting and effective organization of your talents, skills, expertise and decades of experience into streamline single business effectively instead of feeling confused and overwhelmed.</p>
	<hr>
	<p><strong>6. What sets you apart from other freelancers and mentors in the industry?</strong><br>
	  What sets me apart is my ability to blend multiple skills, including technical skills, gaming skills and spiritual skills. My approach is holistic, helping you not only succeed in freelancing but also grow personally and professionally. I&rsquo;ve proven that freelancers can achieve success by continuously learning, adapting, and helping others in their journey. My personal connection to ALLAH (God) with coding, gaming and spirituality adds a unique dimension to the work I do, ensuring that my guidance is grounded in meaningful values.</p>
	<hr>
	<p><strong>7. Do you offer free services or resources for people who cannot afford to pay?</strong><br>
    Yes, I strongly believe in helping those who are in need, particularly the underprivileged. I provide free services to those who cannot afford to pay, including free educational resources, mentorship, and occasional healing services. My goal is to empower people, especially the less fortunate, with knowledge and skills that can change their lives. However, since I believe in teaching others, most of the information I provide is already on the internet for free in the form of my videos, articles, online courses or resources in multiple ways for those who want to take benefit through my wisdom and knowledge without requiring anything to pay me. Even for healing, one can learn spiritual skills and become self-sufficient spiritual freelancer on his/her way and make money healing incurable patients by the Power of Allahﷻ</p>
	<hr>
	<p><strong>8. How do you combine spirituality with your freelancing career?</strong><br>
	  I integrate spirituality into my work by invoking ALLAHﷻ through prayers and using Holy Quran with the wisdom of Islamic teachings to guide my actions and approach to freelancing. This includes offering spiritual guidance, healing, and incorporating values like honesty, respect, and humility into every interaction. I also use my platform to teach others about the importance of faith and self-awareness in achieving both personal and professional success.</p>
	<hr>
	<p><strong>9. What are your core values as a Legendary Freelancer?</strong><br>

	  <li><strong>Adaptability</strong>: Evolving with the changing needs of clients and industries.</li>
	  <li><strong>Faith</strong>: Incorporating Islamic teachings in all aspects of my work.</li>
	  <li><strong>Empathy</strong>: Understanding the needs of others and providing solutions with care.</li>
	  </ul>
	<hr>
	<p><strong>10. Can you help me become a confident freelancer online?</strong><br>
    Yes, I specialize in web development and personal development. I can help you become a very well confident freelancer online through my personal development expertise and help you shine out in the online space with full confidence without falling back again & again due to lack of confidence, self-doubts, fears, insecurities, confusions, stress, social anxiety etc.</p>
	<hr>
	<p><strong>11. How do I get started with your professional services?</strong><br>
    It's very simple, just <a href="contact.htm">contact me</a>  with your requirements and budget then I'll further discuss with you as required.</p>
	<hr>
	<p><strong>12. What is your approach to client relationships and communication?</strong><br>
    I believe in building strong, long-term relationships with clients based on mutual trust, clear communication, and respect. I always listen to my clients&rsquo; needs, ensure that I understand their problems and challenges, and work together to deliver the result they desire. I provide regular updates, ask for feedback, and ensure that result is provided within agreed deadline once the project is started after payment is funded by client into my bank account online or through safe methods shared privately with escrow and protection for both sides such as using Upwork's payment escrow system or some other freelancing platform if client has hesitation of sending payment directly due to the nature of meeting me first time and I truly understand this aspect so that's not a big deal with me as long as my client is well satisfied and peaceful without being worried.</p>
	<hr>
	<p><strong>13. Do you work with clients from all over the world?</strong><br>
    Of course! I work with clients globally. My international freelancing business is not restricted by any location. I have full extensive experience working with international clients globally during various time zones. No matter where ever you are located in the world, when you are with me, you feel like having me together with you without any long distance because I always make myself available to serve my clients as fast as possible even if I do have to sacrifice my sleep in urgent case scenarios when working on urgent projects with tight deadlines or serious issues such as troubleshooting an extensive problem causing headache to my clients.</p>
	<hr>
	<p><strong>14. Can you help me grow my business as a freelancer?</strong><br></p>
	<p dir="ltr">No, I do not help freelancers grow their businesses because that's the responsibility of a freelancer to grow his/her business with what works best in his/her case. However, I provide the best ideas and strategies, suggestions and new perspectives through which a freelancer learns and understands how he/she can scale their income or double, triple their revenue without changing much their strategy if they are already making money through their existing skill. One must know how to make money in order to receive such guidance through me. This is not for absolute beginners who are just starting out and never made any money online as a freelancer.</p>
	<p dir="ltr">I can help you define your niche, increase your rates, understand high-paying clients for your niche, and set up systems that allow you to operate efficiently. Whether you're just starting out or looking to expand, I&rsquo;ll provide guidance on starting or growing a freelance business online (and offline too if you wish so from Pakistan).</p>
   <hr>
	<p><strong>15. What types of projects do you specialize in?</strong><br>
	  I specialize in a wide range of projects, including:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li><strong>Web Development</strong> (custom websites, e-commerce, web apps)</li>
	  <li><strong>Game Development</strong> (game testing, ideas for improvement)</li>
	  <li><strong>Personal Development</strong> (healing, coaching, counseling, mentoring)</li>
	  <li><strong>Video Editing</strong> (youtube content, udemy courses short films)</li>
	  <li><strong>Consulting</strong> (freelancing, religion, passive income, gods)</li>
	  </ul>
	<hr>
   <p><strong>16. What are some of your past successful projects or client stories?</strong><br>
   I  worked with wide varieties of clients from various industries, from website development to game testing. One of my most notable successes was helping a client transform and upgrade a virtual reality cricket game on steam platform that increased their sales and turned negative reviews into positive reviews after applying my ideas and suggestions. Feel free to check my <a href="portfolio.htm">portfolio</a> page.</p>
	<hr>
	<p><strong>17. How can I integrate my passion (e.g., gaming, tech, religion, sports, etc) with freelancing?</strong><br>
    Integrating your passion with freelancing involves aligning your skills and expertise with something you truly enjoy and connecting it to the value you can offer. For example, if you&rsquo;re passionate about gaming, you could create gaming-related content, offer game testing services, or even work on game development. For those passionate about tech, freelancing opportunities include web development, IT support, or technology consulting. If sports excite you, you could offer content creation for sports blogs, sports analytics, or coaching services. Similarly, if your passion lies in religion, you can integrate spiritual guidance, religious content creation, or consulting in faith-based projects. By aligning your freelancing work with your passion, you&rsquo;ll naturally stay motivated and attract clients who share similar interests, creating a fulfilling and sustainable career.</p>
	<hr>
	<p><strong>18. Can you personally guide me if I'm just starting out in freelancing?</strong><br>
	  Absolutely! Whether you&rsquo;re just starting out or have some experience, I can help guide you through the early stages of freelancing. Through online mentoring, I&rsquo;ll show you how to find clients, set your rates, and start your freelancing career with ease. Everyone starts somewhere, and I&rsquo;m here to help you kick start your freelancing career online. The rest you can do it yourself based on provided guidelines, ideas and strategies. The best way to learn is by doing it yourself, anyway :)</p>
