   <h3 class="text-danger">Introduction</h3>
	<p>I am a gamer and a master of multiple skills. By the grace of Allah, I have proven the truth of Islam through miracles in the 21st century and am working as a bearer of the truth of Islam along with my freelancing business. My website encompasses my business, my religious work and my gaming, and I have proven wrong that a gamer cannot do anything.</p>
	<p>In fact, I have proven that what a gamer can do is forever impossible for a non-gamer because those who mock gamers are far behind due to their lack of loyalty to Allah's religion and the gamer has defeated them all by the grace of Allah.</p>
   <p>In the future, any human being, especially the so-called Muslims, should repent from making fun of a gamer, otherwise when more gamers come out to do the work of Islam, then what they will do with the grace of Allah, it will not be possible for even the greatest scientists of the world to compete with them, and I am a walking miracle person on whom Allah has immense grace and mercy.</p>
	<p>Alhamdulillah, Lord of the Worlds<br>

	<p class="urdu" align="right">میں ایک گیمر ہوں اور ملٹی پل اسکلز کا بادشاہ  ہوں۔ میں اللہ کے فضل سے اکیسویں صدی میں معجزات کے ذریعے دین اسلام کی سچائی ثابت کرچکا ہوں اور اپنے فری لانسنگ بزنس کے ساتھ ساتھ اسلام کی سچائی کا علمبردار بن کر کام کررہا ہوں۔میری ویب سائٹ میرے بزنس، میرے دینی کام اور میری گیمنگ، ہر چیز کو سموئے ہوئے ہے اور میں نے یہ بات غلط ثابت کردی ہے کہ ایک گیمر کچھ نہیں کرسکتا۔</p>
	<p class="urdu" align="right">درحقیقت ، میں نے یہ ثابت کیا ہے کہ ایک گیمر جو کچھ کرسکتا ہے وہ نان گیمر کے لیے ہمیشہ کے لیے ناممکن ہے کیونکہ گیمرز کا مذاق اڑانے والے اللہ کے دین سے وفادار نہ ہونے کے سبب بہت پیچھے رہ گئے اور گیمر میدان مارگیا اللہ کے فضل سے۔</p>
	<p class="urdu" align="right">آئندہ کوئی بھی انسان، خصوصا نام نہاد مسلمان اس بات سے توبہ کرلیں کہ وہ کسی گیمر کا مذاق اڑائیں  ورنہ مزید گیمرز جب دین اسلام کا کام کرنے کے لیے میدان میں اتریں گے تو پھر وہ سب اللہ کے فضل سے جو کچھ کریں گے ان کا مقابلہ کرنا دنیا کے بڑے بڑے سائنسدانوں کے بس کی بات بھی نہ ہوگی اور میں اس بات پر چلتا پھرتا معجزاتی انسان ہوں جس پر اللہ کا بے پناہ فضل و کرم ہے۔</p>

Through personalized guidance, I share strategies for finding projects, setting competitive rates, overcoming self-doubts, and showing yourself online with full confidence by understanding yourself and your services with the outcome that only you can provide the best amongst your competitors. This also included mindset coaching, helping you develop resilience and confidence in your freelancing journey.

My approach is holistic, helping you not only succeed in freelancing but also grow personally and professionally. I&rsquo;ve proven that freelancers can achieve success by continuously learning, adapting, and helping others in their journey.

	<hr>
	<p><strong>7. Do you offer free services or resources for people who cannot afford to pay?</strong><br>
    Yes, I strongly believe in helping those who are in need, particularly the underprivileged. I provide free services to those who cannot afford to pay, including free educational resources, mentorship, and occasional healing services. My goal is to empower people, especially the less fortunate, with knowledge and skills that can change their lives. However, since I believe in teaching others, most of the information I provide is already on the internet for free in the form of my videos, articles, online courses or resources in multiple ways for those who want to take benefit through my wisdom and knowledge without requiring anything to pay me. Even for healing, one can learn spiritual skills and become self-sufficient spiritual freelancer on his/her way and make money healing incurable patients by the Power of Allahﷻ</p>
	<hr>
	<p><strong>8. How do you combine spirituality with your freelancing career?</strong><br>

    I believe in building strong, long-term relationships with clients based on mutual trust, clear communication, and respect. I always listen to my clients&rsquo; needs, ensure that I understand their problems and challenges, and work together to deliver the result they desire. I provide regular updates, ask for feedback, and ensure that result is provided within agreed deadline once the project is started after payment is funded by client into my bank account online or through safe methods shared privately with escrow and protection for both sides such as using Upwork's payment escrow system or some other freelancing platform if client has hesitation of sending payment directly due to the nature of meeting me first time and I truly understand this aspect so that's not a big deal with me as long as my client is well satisfied and peaceful without being worried.</p>

	<p><strong>13. Do you work with clients from all over the world?</strong><br>
    Of course! I work with clients globally. My international freelancing business is not restricted by any location. I have full extensive experience working with international clients globally during various time zones. No matter where ever you are located in the world, when you are with me, you feel like having me together with you without any long distance because I always make myself available to serve my clients as fast as possible even if I do have to sacrifice my sleep in urgent case scenarios when working on urgent projects with tight deadlines or serious issues such as troubleshooting an extensive problem causing headache to my clients.</p>

	<p><strong>14. Can you help me grow my business as a freelancer?</strong><br></p>
	<p dir="ltr">No, I do not help freelancers grow their businesses because that's the responsibility of a freelancer to grow his/her business with what works best in his/her case. However, I provide the best ideas and strategies, suggestions and new perspectives through which a freelancer learns and understands how he/she can scale their income or double, triple their revenue without changing much their strategy if they are already making money through their existing skill. One must know how to make money in order to receive such guidance through me. This is not for absolute beginners who are just starting out and never made any money online as a freelancer.</p>
	<p dir="ltr">I can help you define your niche, increase your rates, understand high-paying clients for your niche, and set up systems that allow you to operate efficiently. Whether you're just starting out or looking to expand, I&rsquo;ll provide guidance on starting or growing a freelance business online (and offline too if you wish so from Pakistan).</p>

   <p><strong>16. What are some of your past successful projects or client stories?</strong><br>
   I have <a href="portfolio.htm">worked with clients across different industries</a>, from website development to game testing. One of my most notable successes was helping a client transform and upgrade a virtual reality cricket game on steam platform that increased their sales and turned negative reviews into positive reviews after applying my ideas and suggestions. I have also successfully guided many students through <a href="courses.htm">online courses</a> for freelancing using web development and spiritual healing skills, leading to personal and professional transformation.</p>

	<p><strong>17. How can I integrate my passion (e.g., gaming, tech, religion, sports, etc) with freelancing?</strong><br>
    Integrating your passion with freelancing involves aligning your skills and expertise with something you truly enjoy and connecting it to the value you can offer. For example, if you&rsquo;re passionate about gaming, you could create gaming-related content, offer game testing services, or even work on game development. For those passionate about tech, freelancing opportunities include web development, IT support, or technology consulting. If sports excite you, you could offer content creation for sports blogs, sports analytics, or coaching services. Similarly, if your passion lies in religion, you can integrate spiritual guidance, religious content creation, or consulting in faith-based projects. By aligning your freelancing work with your passion, you&rsquo;ll naturally stay motivated and attract clients who share similar interests, creating a fulfilling and sustainable career.</p>

	<p><strong>18. Can you personally guide me if I'm just starting out in freelancing?</strong><br>
	  Absolutely! Whether you&rsquo;re just starting out or have some experience, I can help guide you through the early stages of freelancing. Through online mentoring, I&rsquo;ll show you how to find clients, set your rates, and start your freelancing career with ease. Everyone starts somewhere, and I&rsquo;m here to help you kick start your freelancing career online. The rest you can do it yourself based on provided guidelines, ideas and strategies. The best way to learn is by doing it yourself, anyway :)</p>
