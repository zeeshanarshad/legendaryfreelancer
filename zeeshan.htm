    <p class="text-muted">My journey was never mine alone. Every skill, every test, every revival was from the Mercy of Allah. I'm here now â€” not to prove, but to serve. To uplift hearts, awaken minds, and stand for truth. Whatever I do â€” be it freelancing, gaming, coding, dawah, or mentoring â€” it is a small service for the Ummah, and a prayer for acceptance by my Rabb.</p>

    <h4 class="fw-bold">Who is Zeeshan?</h4>
    <p>I am a Muslim. A seeker. A freelancer who rose, fell, and rose again by Allah's Mercy. Iâ€™ve built platforms, trained minds, coded systems, fought spiritual battles, and shared truth through media and words. But above all, I am a human â€” trying to benefit the Ummah.</p>

    <p class="mt-4">Let this website be a tool for transformation, not a trophy. And let my efforts bring Muslims come close to Allah, not Shaitan.</p>
